# Wordlitzer - A Wordle bot.

Wordlitzer is a Wordle bot that maximizes information gain with
look-ahead search.

Wordlitzer was initially written in Python, then ported to C++ to
speed it up, then to Go to take advantage of multi-core parallel
processing.

Wordlitzer was written on a whim in a few days. No attempt was made to
clean up the code.
